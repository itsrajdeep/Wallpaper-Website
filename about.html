        <p>
            Welcome to WallArtevo, a curated space for digital art and high-quality wallpapers. 
            Born from a passion for clean design and beautiful imagery, this project was created to provide a simple, 
            elegant platform for discovering your next background. Every wallpaper you see is sourced directly from the 
            incredible community of talented photographers and creators on Pexels, made accessible through the Pexels API.

        <h2>The Creator</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rajdeep Singh, a passionate web developer based in Banglore,India. 
            WallArtevo is a personal portfolio project I built from scratch to demonstrate my skills in front-end development, 
            specifically using HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript. My goal was to create a seamless and visually appealing user 
            experience, from searching for an image to interacting with the interface. This website represents a significant 
            step in my journey as a developer, and I'm excited to continue building intuitive and beautiful applications for 
            the web.
            </p>
